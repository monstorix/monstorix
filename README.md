## Hi 👋
I'm Raymond Nee. A person with multiple hobbies.

Trying to learn many things.

Formerly I used **Monstorix** as a personal pseudonym, but now that name will be mostly used as a project name, which refers to the various works I have produced, including coding, design, audiovisual and so on.

🌏 [Blog (In Construction)](https://monstorix.tk)

📺 [Monstorix Bilibili Channel](https://space.bilibili.com/179485933) (Some videos on radio and television, language learning and everyday life)

You may find me on some other platforms, though I may not very active on them.
